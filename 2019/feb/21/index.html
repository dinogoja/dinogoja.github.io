        With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children, England mourns for
        her dead across the sea. Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of her
        spirit, Fallen in the cause of the free. Solemn the drums thrill; Death
        august and royal Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres, There is music

        went with songs to the battle, they were young, Straight of limb, true
        of eye, steady and aglow. They were staunch to the end against odds
        uncounted; They fell with their faces to the foe. They shall grow not
        old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the
        years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning We will
        remember them. They mingle not with their laughing comrades again; They
        sit no more at familiar tables of home; They have no lot in our labour
        of the day-time; They sleep beyond Englandâ€™s foam. But where our
        desires are and our hopes profound, Felt as a well-spring that is
        hidden from sight, To the innermost heart of their own land they are
        known As the stars are known to the Night;
