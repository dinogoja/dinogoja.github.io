      <h2>Do not go gentle into that good night</h2>
      <i>Dylan Thomas, 1914 - 1953</i>
      <p>
        Do not go gentle into that good night, Old
        age should burn and rave at close of day;
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
        Though wise men at their end know dark is
        right, Because their words had forked no
        lightning they Do not go gentle into that
        good night. Good men, the last wave by,
        crying how bright Their frail deeds might
        have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage
        against the dying of the light. Wild men who
        caught and sang the sun in flight, And
        learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
        Do not go gentle into that good night. Grave
        men, near death, who see with blinding sight
        Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be
        gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the
        light. And you, my father, there on the sad
        height, Curse, bless, me now with your
        fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into
        that good night. Rage, rage against the
        dying of the light.
