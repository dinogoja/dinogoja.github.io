      <h1>LET THE SUNSHINE IN</h1>
      <p>
        We starve, look at one another short of breath Walking proudly in our
        winter coats Wearing smells from laboratories Facing a dying nation of
        moving paper fantasy Listening for the new told lies With supreme
        visions of lonely tunes Somewhere, inside something , there is a rush of
        greatness Who knows what stands in front of our lives I fashion my
        future on films in space Silence tells me secretly ev'rything,
        ev'rything Singing my space songs on a spiderweb star "Life is around
        you and in you" Answer for Timothy Leary, deary Let the sun shine Let
        The sunshine in The sun shine in Let the sun shine Let The sunshine in
        The sun shine in Let the sun shine Let The sunshine in The sun shine in
        Let the sun shine Let The sunshine in The sun shine in
